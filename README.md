## About Me


I am Grishma, currently pursuing my graduate studies at the University of Pittsburgh. My academic background includes a dual degree in B.S.M.S. from IISER Bhopal, where I concentrated on pure mathematics with a focus on Algebra Geometry. Throughout my master's program at the University of Pittsburgh, I collaborated with Dr. Bard Ermentrout in the field of Computational Neuroscience. Presently, I am engaged in research with Dr. Hessam Babaee, exploring reduced order modeling (ROM).

### My ongoing Ph.D. research project


We are dealing with the population model and spiking model which are related by theta transformation and that is why the model is called by the name as theta model. We have shown the transformation calculation in particular. Then we wanted to find out a particular impulse through which we can jump between higher and lower oscillations. The challenge was that we were dealing with a large population of neurons and that is why we had to start with the case study and bifurcation diagram. We got some ideas and I managed to find good parameters so that the neurons behave as we wanted in 9D then we extended the case to the population of neurons and the system responded correctly. Now we were trying to summarise the result. Theta neuron model has application in visual cortex and also in Parkinson's disease as we noticed delayed beta oscillation in Parkinson which can be studied using theta model.
